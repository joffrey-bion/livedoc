<p>
    This is an example of Livedoc documentation displayed in the Livedoc UI.
</p>
<p>
    The most interesting part of Livedoc lies in the APIs and Types documentation, which you can access from the links
    at the top of this page. What you are reading here is the part called the "global documentation", which contains
    multiple parts that you can see in the left-hand side panel:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>this <em>General</em> documentation page, which allows you to write free text in HTML to present your API</li>
    <li>a <em>Change Log</em> section, to display information about the changes in each of the API versions</li>
    <li>a <em>Migrations</em> section, to explain how to migrate from one version to another</li>
</ul>
<p>
    All of these sections are optional, and will only be available if you fill them up. The next paragraphs are
    examples of what could be put in this general section.
