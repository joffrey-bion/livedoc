# What is Livedoc ?

Livedoc is a Java library that inspects the Java code of your API and builds its documentation based on what it found.

It does not need you to use a particular framework, although it integrates very well with Spring.

Last but not least, Livedoc also provides a UI that you can use to visualize the documentation.

# Get started with Livedoc

Choose your Livedoc flavour:

- [Spring MVC](quickstart/springmvc)
- [Spring Boot](quickstart/springboot) (recommended)
- [Other framework](quickstart/plain)
